## What about politics?
### Politics are fun.
You know, politics are fun. I mean, it's quite fascinating to watch people get so riled up about ideas. But it gets annoying when people identify themselves with their opinions. Why? Because opinions change. They're meant to be influenced, challenged, destroyed, reborn, to jump at us, frighten us, encourage and empower us. 

I love opinionated people. They don't stress about not having an opinion. They express themselves freely, never hesitating or saying, "I don't know." So much fun! Why do I love them? Because they are so easily offended. While pretending to know *everything*, they are blind to everything that isn't their *everything*. Talking to them feels like speaking to a brick wall—and honestly, I love it!

Why? Because I wish I could be that convinced of my opinions—right or wrong. Maybe I wouldn't stress that much: "Am I doing the right thing?", "Am I supposed to think like this or like that?", "How should I react?", "What's the right way to think about this?". You know, it feels like a boat that gets pushed by waves from east to west, to north to south... It feels stuck. It feels empty. **That's the trap of absolute certainty.**

### How about standing on something?

*How about standing on something?* Be a person of principles. You can have principles, and while your opinions might change, like a smart sailor, you'll see the waves from east to west, from north to south and navigate clearly to the destination of your choice... even though unknown. 

That's what I love about life—it looks like this to me: one destination, though unknown, with God as the guide. Like stars in the sky-but better. Like a lighthouse-but brighter. Into the unknown. **That's confidence amidst uncertainty.**

I love it and fear it. I hate it and trust it. Oh man, I love this. 

North, west, south... or east? Who cares! I have myself a
rock, not made of cultural or societal thoughts and opinions, but a living guide who makes big waves look like rain puddles and the sun like dandelion puff. 

"The LORD is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer; my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold." Psalm 18:2
